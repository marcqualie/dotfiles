# Marc Qualie's Dot Files

My dot files are shared between all my OSX machines.


## Usage

This repository follows [scripts to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) convention.

For convenience I've included the following shell function which calls `script/update` from anywhere.

``` shell
$ update-dotfiles
```


## TODO

- Rewrite scripts to work with Bash (fresh machines don't have zsh yet)
- Auto configure nginx via ~/src/**/**/.nginx-dev.conf
